# ðŸ“œ Race Menu Overlay to SlaveTats Helper

Convert body paint mods RaceMenu Overlay to SlaveTats and vice versa, plus being able to create mods from scratch just with a texture folder, and organize with visual support and guidance. Includes Papyrus compilation tips and an SSEEdit script to create the ESPFE plugin with just a few clicks.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+**: Download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/). During installation, ensure 'Add Python to PATH' is checked.
- **PyQt5**: Install via pip: `pip install PyQt5`.
- **Pillow**: Required for DDS texture support (including BC7 format): `pip install Pillow pillow_bc7`.
- **Optional: 7-Zip**: For creating .7z archives (the tool falls back to .zip if not installed). Download from [7-zip.org](https://www.7-zip.org/).

### Quick Use (EXE Recommended)

The project is delivered in EXE format for quick use: just download the executable file (available in `distintos/` or releases) and run it wherever you want, without additional installation. The PYW file is completely optional for those who prefer to run from source code.

If you use the PYW:

1. Clone or download the repository to a folder (e.g., `j:/Monitor/BH NPCs/Race Menu HELP V2`).
2. Open a terminal or command prompt in the project directory.
3. Install dependencies: `pip install PyQt5 Pillow pillow_bc7`.
4. Run the tool: `python 020_Race_Menu_psc_creator.pyw`.
   - Pre-built executables (via cx_Freeze or PyInstaller) are available in the `distintos/` folderâ€”no additional setup needed.
5. Ensure the `Data/` folder is present in the project root (contains assets like cat images for Tips tab, DDS backgrounds, and tutorial videos). Paths are relative to the working directory.

**Notes**:

- Tested on Windows 10; uses absolute paths. In VSCode, set the workspace to the project root for proper path resolution.
- No internet connection required; all assets (e.g., Data/CAT images, Data/DDS backgrounds) are local.
- If using a virtual environment, activate it before installing dependencies.

## What does it do?

Race Menu and SlaveTats Helper is a user-friendly desktop application that assists Skyrim Special Edition modders in converting and organizing tattoo/overlay mods between RaceMenu (PSC scripts) and SlaveTats (JSON configurations). It simplifies workflows for creating new mods from raw DDS textures, generating scripts and configs, structuring mod files, and aiding Papyrus compilation. The tool supports both forward and reverse conversions, previewing textures, creating ZIP/7z packages, and managing backups to prevent data loss.

Key features include:

- **Drag-and-Drop Support**: Easily import JSON, PSC, or DDS files/folders directly into tabs for quick processing.
- **Dark Theme Interface**: Custom frameless window with gradient backgrounds, intuitive menus (File for actions, Tabs for shortcuts, Help for About with links to [Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/John1995ac?tab=user+files) and [GitHub](https://github.com/John95ac)), tooltips, and responsive UI elements.
- **Progress Tracking**: Global progress bars and status updates for long operations like file copying or packing.
- **Error Handling and Logging**: Detailed terminal output in each tab (green for info, red for errors, orange for warnings) to monitor processes and troubleshoot issues.
- **Sound Feedback**: Plays a success sound on key actions like file generation.

## Complete Workflow: SlaveTats to RaceMenu Overlay

This workflow describes the 4 steps to convert a SlaveTats mod to a RaceMenu Overlay, integrating the Python tool for the first steps and the Pascal script for the third. Everything is done automatically where possible, with clear guides.

1. **Step 1: Convert JSON to PSC and Organize DDS (Automatic with the Tool)**Use the "SlaveTats â†’ RaceMenu (.psc Generator)" tab to import the SlaveTats JSON. The tool parses the entries (name, section, texture, area), generates the PSC script with AddBodyPaint/AddWarpaint calls, creates the `scripts/Source` folder, organizes the DDS files into `textures/Actors/Character/Overlays/<section>`, and copies the DDS files automatically. Result: PSC ready and DDS organized.
2. **Step 2: Compile PSC to PEX (Multiple Methods, Tool Includes PCA Helper)**Compile the generated PSC to PEX using the Creation Kit, Visual Studio Code with SKSE, or PCA 2022.1 (recommended for speed). The tool includes the "PCA Papyrus Compile Helper" tab to simplify: configure paths in the INI, copy files to `overwrite/source/scripts`, select the PSC, compile with PCA, and move/clean the PEX automatically. Quiet modes reduce logs for better performance.
3. **Step 3: Create ESP Plugin with Pascal Script in SSEdit**Use the Pascal script "Edit Scripts/0002 Race Menu Overlays ESP Creator .pas" in SSEdit (xEdit). The script duplicates a source plugin (select a new or existing destination), sets optional headers (author/description), copies all records with required masters, and for QUST records, allows entering the Papyrus script name (without extension or spaces) to update the FULL, EDID, and VMAD scriptName. After completing:

   - Open the Quest and replace the FormID with your own plugin's FormID.
   - Apply "Clean Masters" to your project.
   - The script opens a video tutorial (Edit Scripts/012.mp4) to see the complete process.
     Result: ESP/ESL plugin ready with the script assigned.
4. **Step 4: Publish the Mod (Optional)**
   If you publish, ask for permission from the original author of the SlaveTats mod. Remove references to SlaveTats from the mod (e.g., clean JSON or configs), compress it into a mod-friendly format (ZIP/7z), and upload it to Nexus or a similar platform. Ensure compatibility with SKSE/OBody.

This end-to-end workflow efficiently converts SlaveTats mods to RaceMenu Overlays, with the tool covering steps 1-2 and the Pascal script covering step 3.

## Main Tabs and Workflows

The application uses a tabbed interface for organized workflows:

1. **SlaveTats â†’ RaceMenu (.psc Generator)**: Drag or select a SlaveTats JSON file to parse overlay entries (name, section, texture, area). Generates a Papyrus PSC script with appropriate AddBodyPaint/AddWarpaint calls. Includes buttons to create an organized texture folder (`textures/Actors/Character/Overlays/<section>`) and copy DDS files, then pack into a ZIP/7z mod archive. Ideal for porting SlaveTats mods to RaceMenu.

   **Step-by-Step**:

   - Drag a JSON file onto the tab or click "Select JSON".
   - Preview the parsed data in the terminal (shows extracted entries).
   - Click "Generate .psc file" to create the script in a new `scripts/Source` folder.
   - Click "Create Texture Folder && Copy DDS" to organize DDS files into the Overlays structure (prompts for the source folder containing DDS).
   - Use "Create Mod zip" to package the mod. Watch the tutorial video via the "Video of final steps" button for post-generation steps (e.g., compiling PEX, creating ESP).
2. **RaceMenu â†’ SlaveTats (.json Generator)**: Drag or select a RaceMenu PSC file to extract Add*Paint calls into a normalized JSON format. Previews the generated JSON and provides options to open the output folder, create mod folders (`textures/actors/character/slavetats/<section>`), and pack the mod into ZIP/7z with cleanup. Perfect for converting RaceMenu overlays to SlaveTats.

   **Step-by-Step**:

   - Drag a PSC file onto the tab or click "Select PSC".
   - Review the extracted entries (names, textures, areas) in the preview terminal.
   - Use "Create Mod folders" to copy DDS files (select the 'Overlays' folder or a subfolder containing DDS) and build the slavetats structure.
   - Click "Create Mod zip" to package the mod (automatically cleans up temporary JSON and textures folders).
3. **ST Creator (from DDS)**: Start from a DDS folder or existing JSON. Displays an editable table for each DDS file (File, Path, Section, Area, Name). Assign areas (Body/Feet/Hand/Face) and names, then export JSON. Supports loading existing JSON to edit/add entries. Create mod structure and ZIP package. Features auto-detection of new DDS files and backups.

   **Step-by-Step**:

   - Drag a DDS folder or JSON file onto the tab, or click "DRAG AND DROP JSON OR DDS FOLDER".
   - Edit the table: assign Section (group name for the overlay), Area (Body/Feet/Hand/Face), and Name (tattoo description) for each file.
   - Click "Export JSON" to generate the file (saved in the parent folder of the DDS directory).
   - Use "Create Mod zip" to build the `textures/actors/character/slavetats` structure and package into ZIP/7z.
   - Manage backups via the "Backups" button (creates/restores timestamped JSON copies).
4. **RM Creator (from DDS)**: Similar to ST Creator but tailored for RaceMenu. Editable table for DDS files (File, Path, Type: BodyPaint/Warpaint/HandPaint/FeetPaint/FacePaint, Name). Drag PSC to load and edit existing scripts. Export PSC to `scripts/Source` and create mod ZIP with Overlays structure.

   **Step-by-Step**:

   - Drag a DDS folder or PSC file onto the tab, or click "DRAG AND DROP PSC OR DDS FOLDER".
   - Edit the table: assign Type (BodyPaint/Warpaint/etc.) and Name for each file.
   - Click "Export .psc" to generate the script in the `scripts/Source` folder.
   - Use "Create Mod zip" to package with the `textures/Actors/Character/Overlays` structure.
5. **PCA Papyrus Compile Helper**: Assists with Papyrus compilation in Mod Organizer 2 (MO2) or standalone mode. Configurable paths via INI (e.g., Source, `overwrite/scripts`). Buttons to copy files to `overwrite/source/scripts`, select/copy .psc files, and move/clean .pex outputs. Includes quiet modes, auto-run on .pex detection, and MO2 emulator support. Terminal logs compilation steps.

   **Step-by-Step**:

   - Click the gear icon (âš™) to configure paths (supports MO2 integration or standalone emulator mode).
   - Click "Copy Files to Scripts" to copy all files from the Source folder to `overwrite/source/scripts`.
   - Select or drag .psc files with "Select and Copy .psc Files" to prepare for compilation.
   - Compile using PCA 2022.1 (the tool monitors .pex files in `overwrite/scripts`).
   - Click "Run Move and Clean" to move compiled .pex files to the destination and clean `source/scripts`.
   - Use checkboxes for quiet modes (reduces logs) and auto-run (triggers on .pex detection).
6. **Tips**: Displays random motivational tips from Advice.ini/tips.ini (supports bold, italic, links) and cute cat images/GIFs from `Data/CAT`. Refreshes on button click for quick breaks during modding. Click "Web Documents John95AC" for online documentation, advancements, and resources.

## Troubleshooting

- **DDS Preview Issues**: Ensure Pillow with BC7 support is installed (`pip install pillow pillow_bc7`). If BC7 DDS fail to load, check the terminal for errors (e.g., "Failed to load"). Test with standard DDS files. Install plugins manually if needed.
- **No 7z Packing**: Install 7-Zip for .7z archives; the tool automatically falls back to .zip (slower but functional).
- **Paths Not Found**: The tool uses absolute paths relative to the working directory (project root). In VSCode, set the workspace to the project folder. For PCA helper, use the gear icon to configure routes (e.g., `source_path` for Source path).
- **INI Configuration**: Edit `Data/PapyrusCompiler.ini` for PCA settings:
  - [PCA] `QuietCopyStep=true` (silent file copying), `QuietPSCStep=true` (no code dumps), `QuietEndStep=true` (minimal cleanup logs), `AutoRunOnAllPex=true` (auto-move on .pex detection).
  - [Route] `source_path` (Source folder), `scripts_path` (`overwrite/scripts`), `source_scripts_path` (`overwrite/source/scripts`).
  - [StandAlone] `mo2emulator=true` (enables standalone MO2 emulator mode).
    Changes are saved automatically and persist across sessions.
- **Mod Compatibility**: This is a development tool, not an in-game plugin. Generated mods are for Skyrim Special Edition/AE and require SKSE, OBody Next Generation, and Address Library for SKSE Plugins in-game. Test in MO2 or Vortex.
- **Performance Tips**: Close other applications during file operations or compilation. Enable Quiet MODE in PCA to reduce console output and improve responsiveness. Restart the tool via File > Restart (Ctrl+R) if the UI lags.

Special thanks to **Wolfen09**. From a casual conversation on Discord, we realized that converting a package from SlaveTats to RaceMenu was complicated because it requires not only a specific folder structure but also a compilation and a plugin. It was a casual conversation, so I put it on the back burner. However, since I had some free time and a great new mod for RaceMenu called [Overlay Distribution Framework](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/155120) was released, I decided to create this program. This tool facilitates and structures the steps to make the conversion process from one to the other much easier.

Special thanks to **[SlaveTats](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19080)**, **[RaceMenu](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19080)**, and **[PCA Papyrus Helper](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23852)**. These are excellent mods and tools that have helped me a lot in my games, especially in Skyrim. Thank you so much for existing.

Special thanks to **[UBE 2.0 Ultimate Body](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/92989)** and **[Bijin Skin UNP and CBBE SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20078)**. Thanks to these magnificent mods for their incredible body textures, which many use as a base for creating and aligning tattoos.

Special thanks to the **Modding Community**. For the constant feedback and ideas for improvements.

Special thanks to **[SSEEdit](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/164)**. Through the use of its Pascal scripting capabilities, it's possible to create the necessary ESP plugin without ever touching the Creation Kit, even though it took months to create the correct code.

Special thanks to the **Python language**. This entire project was made possible by it. Thank you very much.

Special thanks to **[Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/)**, **[Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/)**, and **[Time.Graphics](https://time.graphics/)**. Thanks to these free and very useful tools for drawing and creating diagrams.
